Warning: In order to install Simciy 3000 (vanilla) or Unlimited you will need to have your legally purchased cdrom or legal backup iso of Simcity 3000/3000 unlimited Linux Edition. This program wont provide it or endorse piracy under any circumstances


Instructions:

After you moved your Simcity 30000 iso in the same directory of this python script installer and then launch the python installer

To launch the python script you will have to start the linux terminal and then type cd (directory where this python script is located)

After that to launch it type: python SCU3Installer.py

Enjoy the game!







Instructions if you want to do everything manually without my installer:

Warning: In order to install Simciy 3000 (vanilla) or Unlimited you will need the cdrom or the iso of one of them.
Download the installer:
https://www.liflg.org/?what=dl&catid=7&gameid=99&filename=sc3u_2.0a-multilingual_x86.mojo.run", "sc3u_2.0a-multilingual_x86.mojo.run
And then type the following commands in linux terminal to 
su 
mkdir /media/cdrom 
mount Simcty3000unlimited.iso /media/cdrom
./sc3u_2.0a-multilingual_x86.mojo.run
Warning to make installer run dont forget to go to its properities and mark in its permissions "Allow executing file as program"

In order to get sound in your game you will need to type the following commands
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install osspd




Afterwards to get a custom resolution go to the folder in which the game is located and edit its resolution in the file snapshot.ini or run the game in windowed mode by whenever launch it hit alt+enter after it is launched to force windowed mode or execute it with -w option from terminal.

Also if the last part didnt work to get it running at the same resolution as your screen use the other executable in simcity3000 folder: sc3u.dynamic.sh

If anyone knows how to make the shortcut in desktop or the panel go fullscreen at the right computerÂ´s resolution please tell me so.
